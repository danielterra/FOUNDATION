## Problem 2: Technology Stack Selection

### What
Select technology for each component based on SuperNOVA's unique requirements:

**Desktop Framework**
- Must support Linux, Windows, macOS from single codebase
- Why: Users need one app that runs everywhere without platform-specific builds

**Database**
- Must run embedded (no separate server process)
- Why: Users shouldn't install or configure database servers
- Must support graph traversal (follow relationships in queries)
- Why: RDF triple store connects entities through relationships, not foreign keys
- Must handle append-only workloads efficiently
- Why: Immutable data architecture never updates/deletes, only inserts new facts
- Must support distributed clustering
- Why: Users scale by adding nodes (laptop, cloud server, etc.) to form clusters

**Notes:**
- Backend language determined by desktop framework (e.g., Tauri → Rust)
- Frontend framework determined by desktop framework (e.g., Tauri → any web framework)

---

### Solution: Tauri + Rust + Svelte + SurrealDB

**Desktop Framework: Tauri 2.x**
- Cross-platform: Single codebase for Linux, Windows, macOS [1]
- Small binaries: 3-5 MB (vs 100+ MB for Electron) [2]
- Uses OS-native WebView, not bundled browser [3]
- Active development: 60k+ GitHub stars, backed by major companies [4]

**Backend: Rust**
- Determined by Tauri framework choice
- Memory safety + performance for automation engine
- Direct SurrealDB integration (both Rust)

**Frontend: Svelte 5**
- Works with Tauri out-of-box [5]
- Truly reactive (no virtual DOM overhead)
- Small bundle sizes, fast compilation

**Database: SurrealDB**
- **Embedded mode**: RocksDB backend, zero-config [6]
- **Graph queries**: Native graph traversal with `->` operators [7]
- **Append-only friendly**: Optimized for insert-heavy workloads [8]
- **Distributed clustering**: Built-in multi-node support [9]
- Pure Rust: Clean integration with backend

**Why this combination:**
- Meets all hard requirements (cross-platform, embedded, graph, distributed)
- Single codebase reduces maintenance burden
- Modern tooling enables rapid development
- Production-ready: All technologies have stable 2.x+ releases

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Electron + React**: Rejected due to 100+ MB binaries
- **Pure Rust (Slint/iced)**: Rejected due to slower UI development, smaller talent pool
- **Flutter**: Rejected due to harder Rust/database integration
